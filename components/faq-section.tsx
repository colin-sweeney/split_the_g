      question: "What on earth is the Split The G Challenge?",
      answer: "It's a fun, slightly messy (in a good way!) fundraising challenge inspired by the iconic Guinness pour. You attempt to perfectly split the G in the Guinness logo when taking a sip, donate based on your success, and challenge friends to join the fun. Think of it as the Ice Bucket Challenge, but warmer, tastier, and with a mission to restore vital global health funding!"
    },
    {
      question: "How does this quirky donation structure work?",
      answer: "It's simple! Perfect split = $5 donation. Imperfect split = $10 donation. But don't worry if your splits are consistently imperfect – practice makes perfect, and every donation makes a difference! The real goal is to have fun while supporting an important cause. Plus, you get to enjoy a Guinness, so everyone wins!"
    },
    {
      question: "Where exactly do my donations go?",
      answer: "All donations support the Foreign Aid Bridge Fund, an emergency fund designed to help frontline organizations impacted by the U.S. foreign aid freeze. The fund specifically supports high-impact organizations with sustainable business models that have had their operations curtailed. These organizations work directly with communities in health, water, agriculture, education, and humanitarian response. For example, they've already made 14 emergency grants to organizations like Zvandiri (supporting young people with HIV in Zimbabwe), Maisha Meds (providing affordable healthcare across Africa), and Build Up Nepal (creating climate-resilient housing in disaster-prone areas)."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I have to drink Guinness to participate?",
      answer: "Nope! While the challenge was inspired by the iconic Guinness pour, participation is flexible. Non-beer drinkers can use Guinness 0 (their non-alcoholic option), another beverage of choice, or simply donate directly. The spirit of the challenge is what matters – supporting vital global health initiatives while having a bit of fun!"
    },
    {
      question: "What does Guinness have to do with Africa?",
      answer: "Great question! Africa is actually the world's largest market for Guinness beer, with Nigeria being the second-largest market for the brand outside of the UK. Guinness has been brewed in Africa since 1962 and has become deeply integrated into the culture in many African countries. In Nigeria alone, there are currently three Guinness breweries! This connection makes the challenge especially meaningful, as we're using a product that's popular in many of the same regions affected by global health funding cuts."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I spread the word about this genius challenge?",
      answer: "Just like the Ice Bucket Challenge, nominate three friends after your attempt, share your Split The G moment on social media with the hashtag #SplitTheG, and tell people why this cause matters! You can also share the fact that every donation, no matter how small, makes a real difference to organizations providing essential services to vulnerable communities around the world."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Split The G officially affiliated with Guinness?",
      answer: "Split The G is an independent initiative inspired by the iconic Guinness pour and the beer's cultural significance in regions affected by health funding cuts. While we appreciate Guinness and its role in many communities worldwide, we are not officially affiliated with or endorsed by Guinness. We're just fans with a creative idea for making a difference!"
